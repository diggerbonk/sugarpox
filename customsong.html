<pre>
Order a custom song, hand crafted for you by Sugar Pox.  Lead time: 30 days.

Fill out the form below, we'll send an invoice to your specified payment provider.

Vocals. Who would you like singing on your custom song? If you want multiple vocalists, there is a price multiplier - we multiply the sum of the vocal coast times the number of vocal tracks. If you do not choose a vocalists you'll get an instrumental; not our forte but a very economical option!

    [] Elyse : $150.00
	[] Trent : $100.00
    [] Troy  : $100.00
	Multiplier: Total times number of singers.

Length. We charge by the minute (+/- 30 seconds) using the following formula: $100 * number of minutes * (number of minutes - 1). If you've forgotten your PEMDAS, the resulting price structure looks like this:

    2 minute song : $200
	3 minute song : $600
	4 minute song : $1200
	5 minute song : $2000

    [ 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 ] Song Length
