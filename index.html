<!-- Sugar Pox is a pop-punk-y outfit that can trace its lineage to an early 90's Boise band called Splinter (IYKYK).  The sounds Sugar Pox makes would see Buffalo Tom, Replacements, and Dinosaur Jr blush!  Elyse Thorpe - Bass/Vox (Splinter, Hardluck Shovel), Trent McNair  - Guitar/Vox (Splinter, Thought Crime), and Troy Wright - Drums/Backing Vox (Psychic Knot, Treepeople, Troyject) convened in Spring of 2023 to hammer out the wily songs of Trent and Elyse in Andy Agenbroad's studio the Chop Shop.  In anticipation of releasing these songs, live gigs were booked and performed.  Hope to see you all!!! -->
