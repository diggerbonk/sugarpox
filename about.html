Spend enough decades playing in Boise bands and sooner or later you end up in the perfect sparkly amalgum of comraderie, strummy pop-punk, and winsome harmonies. Sugar Pox is collaboration of long-time friends Trent McNair (Thoughtcrime, Splinter_), Elyse Thorpe (Hardluck Shovel, Splinter, 10th St. Hornets), and Troy Wright (Psychic Knot, Treepeople, Troyject). The current line-up came together in 2023 to create their first album, Bite, at the Chop Shop Recording Studio. Releaased in May 2024, Bite combines the nimbleness of post punk with a swirm of mercurial proginess and arresting alternating vocals. In anticipation and support of Bite Sugar Pox played Treefort Music Fest 2024 and other favorite Boise venues. 2024 goals include getting into a new practice space, playing summer dates with Built to Spill, getting to work on the songs for ht enext album, and finally learning to play a cover.
